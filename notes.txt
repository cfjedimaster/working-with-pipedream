What is Pipedream?

From the docs:
	Pipedream is an integration platform for developers to build and run workflows that integrate apps and data.

	Develop any workflow, based on any trigger.
	Workflows are code, which you can run for free.
	Workflows run serverlessly: you manage no infrastructure of your own.

From me:
	I have an idea:
	Warning - not a practical idea
	Build a dating site for werewolves and have it send email notifications on a full moon

	every day - 
	check the moon phase - 
	if full - 
	send email

	PD comes in and say

	every day (PD does this)
	check the moon phase - 
	if full - 
	send email (PD does this)

Every boring bit - done
Every fun bit - for me!
